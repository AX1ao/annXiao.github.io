## Hi, I'm Ann Xiao 👋🏼

##### 📄 [Download Résumé](/assets/resume.pdf)

I recently completed my M.S. in Computer Science at NYU (2025) and hold a B.S. in Computer Science & Data Science from UW–Madison (2023).

My interests span systems programming, databases, parallel computing, and applied AI. I’ve built projects ranging from a Unix shell and distributed transaction manager to GPU performance prediction and visual language model distillation.

I’m a self-motivated engineer who enjoys tackling complex problems, learning new technologies quickly, and collaborating across teams to deliver impactful solutions.

I’m actively seeking new graduate Software Engineer opportunities to apply my skills and grow as an engineer, and avilable to start immediately. Please see some of my featured projects below!
